This project was really hard for me to understand; definetely our hardest project yet.
One of the biggest issues was some unexpected error endings when trying to normally progress
through the code, and this took a lot of confusing revision to fix. I tried to lay out the foundation
of this code thoroughly but I might have bit off more than I can chew. Regardless, this was a good
project.
